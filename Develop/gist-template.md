# Understanding Regular Expressions: A Beginner's Guide

## Summary

Regular expressions (regex) are tools for finding patterns in text. While they might seem complex, breaking them down makes them easier to grasp. This guide will walk you through different parts of regex in simple terms.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors like ^ and $ specify where a match should start or end.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers like *, +, and ? define how many times a character or group should appear.

### OR Operator
The | symbol allows you to match one pattern or another.

### Character Classes
Character classes like [] match any character from a specified set.

### Flags
Flags like "i" for case-insensitive matching modify regex behavior.

### Grouping and Capturing
Parentheses () group parts of a pattern for reference later.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions like [] match characters within a specified range.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
Regex quantifiers are greedy by default but can be made lazy with ?.

### Boundaries
Boundaries like \b match specific points in the text.

### Back-references
Back-references like \1 refer back to captured groups.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead (?=) and look-behind (?<=) assertions check for patterns before or after the main match.
